### Project Description:
The Lesson 8 Assignment focuses on building an application that displays movie information. The application was created to display a movie’s title, plot, release data, popularity rating, language, and poster after searching for the specific movie name. jQuery and Ajax were utilized to analyze JSON data that was returned from a 3rd party server. The first step included creating a TMDB account and registering for a TMDB API key, which was later added to the code. Next, code was created including a DOM element and JSON name to display the various headings. Lastly, jQuery code was used to retrieve certain data from the server, so it could be added it to the HTML document by creating code that used the key “json.results[0]….” and an id followed by the DOM name. By completing these steps, a fully functional application was created.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A concept I learned in this lesson is what Ajax is. Ajax allows client web pages to quickly interact and exchange data with a web server, without reloading the entire web page. Ajax works by relying on programming language like JavaScript and data interchange formats like JSON or XML.
2. A concept I learned in this lesson is how AJAX functions. When an event occurs in the browser it creates an XMLHttpRequest, which is sent to the server where it is processed. The server then creates a response and sends data back to the browser. The browser then processes the returned data using JavaScript and updates the page’s content.
3. A concept I learned in this lesson is the advantages of JSON. Some of the advantages include a lighter syntax than XML and is quicker to process, as well as it is frequently used with AJAX to perform asynchronous data loading. JSON is also supported by major browsers, frames and most of the most modern languages.
